# Expense-Tracker-Project

This Project from Codecademy is about the topic Redux Toolkit.
It simplifies to configure the store with the method configureStore and createSlice. 
With CreateSlice you will reduce code, it takes one parameter called option, option is an object with properties, that include all the important properties.
It will update the states and dispatch. 
The logic that is written will be immutable, thanks to "Immer". 
Redux Toolkit is the prefered way.
